		"description": "Motivated by the idea of learning the language of the land of the rising sun, I created a small web page with the sole objective of generating random Romajis. This way, I could practice rewriting the Romaji displayed in Hiragana & Katakana. Why ? To not always write them in traditional order (a, i, u, e, o) and thus, be sure to really know them.<br/><br/>When the web page was finished, my friends told me it would be nice if we could see the answer (convert the romaji into kana), have a progress bar, choose only Hiraganas or Katakanas and many other things.<br/><br/>I follow these advices and gradually improved the generation module, thinking that it would keep me busy. Contemplating my cute little generation module, a thought came to my mind: finally, why not make a beautiful website and adding some modules, entirely dedicated to learning Japanese ?",
